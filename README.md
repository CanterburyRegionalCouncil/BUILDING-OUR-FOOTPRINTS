# BUILDING-OUR-FOOTPRINTS
A mapping competition that was run for school students! Help build gis data for the Canterbury rebuild from the comfort of your PC or laptop.  A building footprint is a 2D shape of where a building touches the ground. It is an essential part of managing property information, and can be used for many different tasks, including emergency services response and disaster recovery.  By participating in this project, students will contribute vital information for our property management, and for our emergency response.  Solution has a simply sign up then the user can start mapping!
