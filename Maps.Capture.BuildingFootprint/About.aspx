    <h3>The Rules</h3>
    <p>
        The task is simple – we need your help to create this dataset, and in the process help our officials and emergency services become better prepared for future recovery situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need you to log-on to our site, and map the extent of buildings from up to date aerial imagery. This is done by simply clicking on the map around the shape of a building, and double clicking to finish the drawing. This <a href="instructionvideo.aspx">quick video</a> will show you just how easy it is to contribute. If you can tell us a bit about the building too, that would be very helpful- is it residential or commercial? Is it a community building like a school or hall, and how many floors does it have?
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh and one thing we can’t forget – this is a competition! Research is underway through the University of Canterbury to analyse information provided by volunteers like yourself, and work out how trustworthy it is. That’s why at the start we need to collect a bit of information about you – your school, your year at school, the suburb where you live, and your best subject. These are all analysed, and the building footprint you create will be given a trust rating between 1% and 100% – 100% being great, and 1% being not so flash.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that’s where the competition comes in - The school that creates the greatest number of footprints – with a trust rating of 75% or better – will win some great prizes!
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, there are prizes for individuals – first, second and third - for the people who create the greatest number of footprints – with a trust rating of 75% or better!
    </p>
    <p>
        So we need you, for a month starting 28 July 2014, to help us capture all of the building footprints in the region – starting with Selwyn, and also working on Waimakariri and Christchurch City. Yes it is a race, and there are only four weeks to generate the most spatial data and the best quality, and earn some great prizes.
